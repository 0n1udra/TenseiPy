        # However, you will need to use classes to use __subs list feature. Substitute inputs for the same actions.
        # E.g. 'eat grass', 'predate grass', or 'eat more grass' run the same function for that action (sub path) without making multiple functions.
        # Adds some player freedom, however you will have to add all the different alternatives for that action.

> Start with ChapterXX function with Chapter_XX class to start with.
> Evoke action_menu to update available actions for player and to start a new section of story.
> Pass in Rimuru_Tempest object when starting chapter.
> Functions and class starting with _ will progress the storyline.
> action_menu grabs functions and classes under passed in object, then shows the user the available actions.
> Use class for nesting more paths in, and functions for the end of a path.


Reading Variable Names:
Name []         -- List
Name {}         -- Dictionary
Name ()         -- Set
Name True/False -- boolean
Name()          -- Function
Name:           -- Class

When I say attribute it means skills and/or resistances.
In function docstring's Usage section, '>' means example of user input in game.
