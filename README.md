# TenseiPy

Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime)
Python text adventure game based off of the managa. (events and dialogue are NOT 100% accurate)

If you have any questions, or would like to contribute: dt01@pm.me

NOTE: Currently, knowing the story from manga/LN/anime is recommended. I am trying my best to make the game as intuitive as I can for people that don't, but knowing the story beforehand will help you not get lost in the parts that aren't as straight forward.
